I want to make an geometrical origami bird that can flap its wings 

Setup 

	- Create canvas 500*500
	- Background from background references 
Draw

	- Triangle - positioned to mach the beak 
	- Quad - body 
	- Back wing - as I put the different shapes together the previous coordinates of the other shapes helped guide me 
	
I succeeded in making the bird. 

Animation 

I want to animate the wings of the bird, but I am not sure how to do this. I'm thinking of two different ways; 
	- Hit the space bar to flap the wings 
	- Clap your hands to flap wings 
	
I prefer to make it so that the wings flap when you clap your hands= via sound. I want to make it interactive and closer to you than simply pressing a button

As i started to investigate how this could be made possible I got frustrated. I couldnt find a suitable syntax and i tried some of them which led to frustrations. I tried redraw and loop because they seemed to be most suitable. I looked at the reference and tried to apply the syntax to my code. What happened was either parts of the bird dissapearing or everything dissapearing entirely.
